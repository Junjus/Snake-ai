# Learn and Progress Steps in the Project

## 1. Phase: Setting up git repository & snake script

## 2.Phase: Getting started with pytorch

1. Watched a [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36lUUr864M) about pytorch.
    1. Installing Cuda for GPU-processing
    Installing pytorch for machine-learning

    2. Basic tensor-operations

    3. Autograd for gradiants for weight optimization

    4. Backpropagation to adjust weights by using the gradiants
